# Tejesh's Healthcare Bot: Multi-Agent AI System for Healthcare

## Introduction
Hello, I'm Tejesh, and this repository showcases my project, "Build MultiAgent Chatbot with AG2 (AutoGen) for Healthcare," offered through IBM. In this project, I've developed AutoMed, a sophisticated Multi-Agent AI system that uses AG2 (AutoGen) technology to provide healthcare treatment recommendations. My goal was to integrate cutting-edge Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze user symptoms, suggest treatments, and access medical databases for real-time, accurate healthcare assistance.

## Project Description
AutoMed is not just a chatbot; it's a dynamic assembly of multiple AI agents, each specializing in different aspects of healthcare consultation. This system orchestrates these agents to collaborate on patient inquiries, offering a level of interaction and understanding that mimics human healthcare providers.

### Features
- **Symptom Analysis**: Utilizes NLP to interpret and assess user-reported symptoms.
- **Treatment Recommendation**: Offers suggestions based on the analyzed symptoms and historical data.
- **Database Interaction**: Connects in real-time to medical databases for up-to-date information.
- **Agent Collaboration**: Ensures that all agents work in harmony to provide a cohesive response.

## Technologies Used
- AG2 (AutoGen)
- Python
- GPT-4 and other LLMs
- Docker (provided by IBM Skills Network Labs)

## Reflection
This project was an incredible learning opportunity to delve into the realm of artificial intelligence, especially within the healthcare sector. Designing a system that could potentially guide real-world decisions added a layer of complexity and responsibility, pushing me to ensure precision and reliability in the agents' design.

## Setup and Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/teja111111/Healthcare-Chatbot.git
cd Healthcare-Chatbot
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## Conclusion
Building AutoMed has reinforced my understanding of multi-agent systems and their potential in practical applications, especially in critical fields like healthcare. I am excited about the future possibilities of integrating more advanced AI to further enhance the accuracy and helpfulness of healthcare systems.
