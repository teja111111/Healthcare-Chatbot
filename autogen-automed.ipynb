Automated Workflow Generation\n","\n","You can orchestrate workflows for AI-driven automation, such as AI-assisted programming, research, and document generation.\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","- Automating software debugging where AI identifies issues, suggests fixes, and verifies solutions.\n","\n","### 4. Supports Human-AI Collaboration\n","\n","AutoGen allows humans to intervene in AI-driven workflows by providing feedback or manually guiding agents when necessary.\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","- A research assistant AI drafts a report, but a human expert refines it.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"62a6a00f-c0ac-4539-8938-c8bb6127c628","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Comparison: AutoGen vs Traditional AI Agents\n","\n","<table width=\"60%\" align=\"left\" >\n","        <thead>\n","            <tr>\n","                <th>Feature</th>\n","                <th>Traditional AI Agents</th>\n","                <th>AutoGen AI Agents</th>\n","            </tr>\n","        </thead>\n","        <tbody>\n","            <tr>\n","                <td>Interactivity</td>\n","                <td>Works alone</td>\n","                <td>Collaborates with other agents</td>\n","            </tr>\n","            <tr>\n","                <td>Learning Ability</td>\n","                <td>Static</td>\n","                <td>Adaptive & iterative</td>\n","            </tr>\n","            <tr>\n","                <td>Workflow Handling</td>\n","                <td>Predefined</td>\n","                <td>Dynamic & evolving</td>\n","            </tr>\n","            <tr>\n","                <td>Human Intervention</td>\n","                <td>Limited</td>\n","                <td>Supports human-AI collaboration</td>\n","            </tr>\n","        </tbody>\n","</table>\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"5023ea6c-d005-482b-9d1d-48119a12243f","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["The OpenAI() function initializes an API client object by calling its constructor, which automatically manages API key retrieval.\n","\n","The code_execution_config dictionary is set up to signal to other functions that Docker should not be used during code execution, thus ensuring that your code runs directly on the host environment and avoiding Docker-related issues.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","id":"caf47280-ccf9-4ae0-bd9f-ba59230c1176","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["\n# Initialize OpenAI Client (API Key is automatically managed from environment variables or configured in OpenAI settings)\nclient = OpenAI()\n\n# Disable Docker execution to prevent runtime errors\ncode_execution_config = {\"use_docker\": False}"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3bfd4dca-179b-4c90-a961-208d1c51da66","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# How AutoMed Works: Multi-Agent AI in Action\n","When a user interacts with AutoMed, the system does not simply generate a response—it triggers a team of AI agents, each with a specific role in processing the query.
